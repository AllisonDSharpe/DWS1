		<h2> Introduction </h2>
    		<p> A <strong> video game </strong> is an electronic game that involves human interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device. The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device, but it now implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. The electronic systems used to play video games are known as platforms; examples of these are personal computers and video game consoles. These platforms range from large mainframe computers to small handheld devices. Specialized video games such as arcade games, while previously common, have gradually declined in use. Video games have gone on to become an art form and industry.	
    		</p>
			<p> The input device primarily used to manipulate video games is called a game controller, and varies across platforms. For example, a controller might consist of only a button and a joystick, while another may feature a dozen buttons and one or more joysticks. Early personal computer games often needed a keyboard for gameplay, or more commonly, required the user to buy a separate joystick with at least one button. Many modern computer games allow or require the player to use a keyboard and a mouse simultaneously. A few of the most common game controllers are gamepads, mouses, keyboards, and joysticks. In recent years, additional methods of input have emerged such as camera-based player observation for video game consoles and touch-sensitive screens on mobile devices. 
			</p>
			<p> Video games typically use additional means of providing interactivity and information to the player. <em> Audio </em> is almost universal, using sound reproduction devices, such as speakers and headphones. Other feedback may come via haptic peripherals, such as vibration or force feedback, with vibration sometimes used to simulate force feedback.

		<h2> History </h2>
			<p> Although the first video games appeared in the 1950s, they were played on massive computers connected to vector displays, not analog televisions. Ralph H. Baer conceived the idea of a home video game in 1951. In the late 1960s while working for Sanders Associates he created a series of video game console designs. One of these designs, which gained the nickname of the <q>Brown Box</q>, featured changeable game modes and was demonstrated to several TV manufactures ultimately leading to an agreement between Sanders Associates and Magnavox. 
			</p> 
		 
			<p> In 1972 Magnavox released the <q> Magnavox Odyssey </q>, the first home video game console which could be connected to a TV set. Ralph Baer's initial design had called for a huge row of switches that would allow gamers to turn on and off certain components of the console (the Odyssey lacked a CPU) to create slightly different games like tennis, volleyball, hockey, and chase. Magnavox replaced the switch design with separate cartridges for each game. Although Baer had sketched up ideas for cartridges that could include new components for new games, the carts released by Magnavox all served the same function as the switches and allowed gamers to choose from the Odyssey's built-in games. 			      
       	    </p>
			<p>The Odyssey only initially sold about 100,000 units, making it moderately successful, and it was not until Atari's arcade game <em> Pong </em> popularized video games, that the public began to take more notice of the emerging industry. By autumn 1975, Magnavox, bowing to the popularity of Pong, cancelled the Odyssey and released a scaled-down version that played only Pong and hockey, the Odyssey 100. A second, <q> higher end </q> console, the Odyssey 200, was released with the 100 and added on-screen scoring, up to four players, and a third gameâ€”Smash. Almost simultaneously released with Atari's own home Pong console through Sears, these consoles jump-started the consumer market. All three of the new consoles used simpler designs than the original Odyssey with no board game pieces or extra cartridges. 
			</p>

			<p> In the years that followed, the market saw many companies rushing similar consoles to market. After General Instrument released their inexpensive microchips, each containing a complete console on a single chip, many small developers began releasing consoles that looked different externally, but internally were playing exactly the same games. Most of the consoles from this era were dedicated consoles playing only the games that came with the console. These video game consoles were often just called video games, because there was little reason to distinguish the two yet. While a few companies like <strong> Atari </strong>, <strong> Magnavox </strong>, and newcomer <strong> Coleco </strong> pushed the envelope, the market became flooded with simple, similar video games.

		<h2> Genres </h2>
			<p> <strong> Video game genres </strong> are used to categorize video games based on their gameplay interaction rather than visual or narrative differences. A video game genre is defined by a set of gameplay challenges. They are classified independent of their setting or game-world content, unlike other works of fiction such as films or books. For example, a <em> shooter game </em> is still a shooter game, regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in outer space. Within game studies there is a lack of consensus in reaching accepted formal definitions for game genres, some being more observed than others. Like any typical taxonomy, a video game genre requires certain constants. Most video games feature obstacles to overcome, so video game genres can be defined where obstacles are completed in substantially similar ways.
			</p> 	
			<p> Following is a listing of commonly used video game genres with brief descriptions and examples of each. This list is by no means complete or comprehensive. Chris Crawford noted in 1984 that <q>the state of computer game design is changing quickly. We would therefore expect the taxonomy presented here to become obsolete or inadequate in a short time.</q> As with nearly all varieties of genre classification, the matter of any individual video game's specific genre is open to personal interpretation. Moreover, it is important to be able to think of each individual game as belonging to several genres at once.

		<h3> Gaming Consoles </h3>
			 <p> There are many video games out there today, but only few gaming consoles that they are programmed for. Some people prefer one over the other, and some people prefer all of the above. Here is the list for the types of gaming consoles that exist <em>today</em>: 
		 	</p>
		
			<ol>
				<li> Xbox </li>
				<li> Playstation </li>
				<li> Nintendo </li> 
			</ol> 
		
		<h3> Gaming Perspective </h3> 
			 <p> All video games have their particular genres, but perspective plays a huge role in video games as well. Here are the three main perspectives in gaming:

			 	<li> First Person </li>
				 <li> Second Person </li>
			 	<li> Third Person </li>
